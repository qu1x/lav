	/// * IEEE-754 very precisely specifies the bit layout of floats.
	///
	/// However there is one caveat: prior to the 2008 version of IEEE-754, how to interpret the NaN
	/// signaling bit wasn't actually specified. Most platforms (notably x86 and ARM) picked the
	/// interpretation that was ultimately standardized in 2008, but some didn't (notably MIPS). As
	/// a result, all signaling NaNs on MIPS are quiet NaNs on x86, and vice-versa.

	/// preserving the exact bits. This means that any payloads encoded in NaNs will be preserved
	/// even if the result of this method is sent over the network from an x86 machine to a MIPS
	/// one.
	///
	/// If the results of this method are only manipulated by the same architecture that produced
	/// them, then there is no portability concern.
