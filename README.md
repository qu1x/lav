# Features

  * SIMD lane trait `Real` abstracting over `f32` and `f64`.
  * SIMD vector trait `SimdReal<Real, LANES>` abstracting over `Simd<f32, LANES>` and
    `Simd<f64, LANES>`.
  * Generic associated type (GAT) `Real::Simd<LANES>` as part of SIMD lane trait `Real`
    implementing SIMD vector trait `SimdReal<Self, LANES>` for itself as lane type where the
    GAT is generic over the number of SIMD vector `LANES`.
  * Lanewise approximate equality test wrt to epsilon and [ULP] SIMD vectors.
  * [`no_std`] without loss of functionality by enabling the [`libm`] feature.

This [`example`] uses SIMD generically over floating-point types while hiding it from the user.
This is useful for crates that can be efficiently implemented without [AoS, SoA, or AoSoA] like
the projective geometric algebra crate [`pga`] (work in progress).
